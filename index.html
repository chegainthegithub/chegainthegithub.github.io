<h1>Welcome to the Jungle!</h1><br>
Fuck the police coming straight from the underground<br>
A young nigga got it bad cause I'm brown<br>
And not the other color so police think<br>
They have the authority to kill a minority<br>
Fuck that shit, cause I ain't the one<br>
For a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun<br>
To be beating on, and throwing in jail<br>
We can go toe to toe in the middle of a cell<br>
Fucking with me cause I'm a teenager<br>
With a little bit of gold and a pager<br>
Searching my car, looking for the product<br>
Thinking every nigga is selling narcotics<br>
You'd rather see, me in the pen<br>
Than me and Lorenzo rolling in a Benz-o<br>
Beat a police out of shape<br>
And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape<br>
To tape off the scene of the slaughter<br>
Still getting swoll off bread and water<br>
I don't know if they fags or what<br>
Search a nigga down, and grabbing his nuts<br>
And on the other hand, without a gun they can't get none<br>
But don't let it be a black and a white one<br>
Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top<br>
Black police showing out for the white cop<br>
Ice Cube will swarm<br>
On any motherfucker in a blue uniform<br>
Just cause I'm from the CPT<br>
Punk police are afraid of me, huh<br>
A young nigga on the warpath<br>
And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath<br>
Of cops, dying in L.A<br>
<p>Yo Dre, I got something to say</p>

Fuck Tha Police<br>
Fuck Tha Police<br>
Fuck Tha Police<br>
<p>Fuck Tha Police</p>

Fuck the police and Ren said it with authority<br>
Because the niggas on the street is a majority<br>
A gang, is with whoever I'm stepping<br>
And the motherfucking weapon is kept in<br>
A stash box, for the so-called law<br>
Wishing Ren was a nigga that they never saw<br>
Lights start flashing behind me<br>
But they're scared of a nigga so they mace me to blind me<br>
But that shit don't work, I just laugh<br>
Because it gives them a hint not to step in my path<br>
For police, I'm saying, "Fuck you punk!"<br>
Reading my rights and shit, it's all junk<br>
Pulling out a silly club, so you stand<br>
With a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand<br>
But take off the gun so you can see what's up<br>
And we'll go at it punk, and I'mma fuck you up!<br>
Make you think I'mma kick your ass<br>
But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast<br>
I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime<br>
But I'mma smoke them now and not next time<br>
Smoke any motherfucker that sweats me<br>
Or any asshole that threatens me<br>
I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope<br>
Taking out a cop or two, they can't cope with me<br>
The motherfucking villain that's mad<br>
With potential, to get bad as fuck<br>
So I'mma turn it around<br>
Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound<br>
{*BOOM, BOOM*}<br>
Yeah, something like that<br>
But it all depends on the size of the gat<br>
Taking out a police would make my day<br>
<p><p>But a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say</p></p>


I'm tired of the motherfucking jacking<br>
Sweating my gang, while I'm chilling in the shack, and<br>
Shining the light in my face, and for what?<br>
Maybe it's because I kick so much butt<br>
I kick ass -- or maybe cause I blast<br>
On a stupid-ass nigga when I'm playing with the trigger<br>
Of an Uzi or an AK<br>
Cause the police always got something stupid to say<br>
They put out my picture with silence<br>
Cause my identity by itself causes violence<br>
The E with the criminal behavior<br>
Yeah, I'm a gangsta, but still I got flavor<br>
Without a gun and a badge, what do ya got?<br>
A sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot<br>
By me, or another nigga<br>
And with a gat it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger<br>
(MC Ren: Size don't mean shit, he's from the old school fool)<br>
And as you all know, E's here to rule<br>
Whenever I'm rolling, keep looking in the mirror<br>
And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a<br>
Dumb motherfucker with a gun<br>
And if I'm rolling off the 8, he'll be the one<br>
That I take out, and then get away<br>
While I'm driving off laughing this is what I'll say police
